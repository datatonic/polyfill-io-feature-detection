## When should I use polyfill-io-feature-detection?
+ You want to isolate your app code from the browser supported features (applying polyfills)
+ You have to add polyfills to yout web application because requires support to different browsers and devices
+ You want to use polyfill service like polyfill.io instead of including the polyfills in your bundle
+ You want (should) to load polyfills only when needed
+ You want to optimize the experience for users on modern browser
+ You want to save the polyfill service call when possible (using this polyfillLoader)

If you meet all these requirements, you probably will love this package. Because it allows you to load polyfills dynamically only when your browser really need it.


## Usage
```js
function App () {
    // your app code here
}

import { polyfillLoader } from 'polyfill-io-feature-detection';
polyfillLoader({
  "features": "Promise",
  "onCompleted": App
});
```
